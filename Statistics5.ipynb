    "Q1: Estimation Statistics:\n",
    "\n",
    "Estimation statistics is a branch of statistics that deals with estimating population parameters (e.g., mean, proportion, variance) based on sample data. When it is not feasible or practical to collect data from an entire population, researchers take a sample from that population and use statistical techniques to make inferences about the unknown population parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Point Estimate: A point estimate is a single value that is used to estimate the population parameter. It is calculated based on the sample data and serves as the best guess for the unknown population parameter. For example, the sample mean is often used as a point estimate for the population mean.\n",
    "Interval Estimate: An interval estimate provides a range of values within which the true population parameter is likely to lie, along with a level of confidence. It is represented as an interval or a range of values and is derived from the sample data. The most common type of interval estimate is the confidence interval, which provides an estimate of the parameter along with an associated level of confidence.\n",
